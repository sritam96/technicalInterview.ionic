## Task 1
As a user, I must be able to find a city and view it on the map.
Implements the following page using Ionic v5 and Angular. The search box must integrate the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) to provide the autocomplete feature for a city search. The real map must replace the map icon after the user selection.
